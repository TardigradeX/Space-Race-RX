SpaceRace RX

Description
SpaceRace RX is a multiplayer racing competition, where multiple players race through course. On the way the players can collect items which give benefits to them or penalties to the opponents. 
In order to play the game, you just need a browser to go online, and your smartphone. Connect your smartphone to the computer and use it as a controller, in order to race against your friends. 

Game idea
In SpaceRace RX you have to maneuver your space ship through a course and reach the goal before your opponents do. While you race maneuver your ship through the course you can collect items to gain benefits or put penalties upon the other space ships. 
But be careful! You can hit obstacles, pump into other space ships or get burst at the wall. If you hit an obstacle or the wall, your space ship is destroyed, and will start again at the beginning. However, if you manage to pump into a opponent’s space ship, you can force him to hit the wall and make him/her start the course again.

Maneuvering
You need your smartphone in order to steer your space ship and maneuver through the course. The space ship has thrusters, which you can activate by pushing the respective buttons on your smartphone’s display. By activating only one thruster, you can rotate your space ship, and pushing both buttons simultaneously allows you to move your space ship forward.
